# A community of your peers

With this shared language, we can all help each other much more effectively.

I'm in 'small business' forums. They have channels with broad names like 'finance' or 'technology'. And so the conversations in them are broad, and not particularly helpful.

When the community mirrors the structure of the system, we can start to talk specifics. Need help with your backups? Jump in to `14.14 Data storage & backups` and hopefully there's a helpful nerd on hand!

And you can repay the favour. Your speciality might be `11.22 Business insurance`, which us nerds typically know little about.

This means that we're going to keep our channels focused. We'll be moderating: if you stray off topic, we'll nudge you back.

## The system learns

The problem with forums and chat channels is that knowledge typically gets lost over time. We all know how painful it is trying to search a chat channel.

So we'll be actively looking for knowledge that should be persistent, and feeding it back in to the system. That might be improving the descriptions in your index so that you can find things more easily, clarifying ambiguity, or creating and improving your ops manuals.

Either way, that's our job. Not yours.

## We do this together

There's a reason many of us don't have good backups, or that we haven't confirmed that they actually work. It's because it's really boring! Let's not pretend that it isn't.

But we can help each other by doing it together. We'll coordinate the community to keep you on track. There's already a [World Backup Day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/), 31st March. So let's use that and spend an hour or so making sure that everything's working.

## This isn't for your get-rich-quick idea

There are forums on the internet full of 'tech bros' looking for their next get-rich-quick idea.

This isn't one of them.

If you don't already have a business idea, this is not the place to find one. This is a place for people who are executing, or for those who have an idea and are just starting.

It's a place for the doers, not the dreamers.

Of course, there's always a place for idle chitchat. So there's a channel, `#water-coolerðŸš°`, for those of you that want to catch up on weekend plans, favourite shows, or the latest sports news.
