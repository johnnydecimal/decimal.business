# None of us got any training

I remember the workplace of 2000. We had computers, sure. But they did far less. They were much slower. And we didn't all carry one round in our pocket.<FootnoteRef number="5" ref="palm" />

25 short years later and computers are _everything_. Everything you do depends on a computer. You might have the most analogue business in the world--maybe you make furniture by hand--but still, your entire business is on the computer.

Fortunately, we all got that three-month training course to bring us up to speeâ€“ oh, wait... that's right. None of us got any training!

The result? Inefficiency. My least favourite thing rears its ugly head again. So you can think of this system as the IT training you never got. We'll show you how to do it right: how to save things, how to name things, what's safe to duplicate, what isn't.

All the basic stuff that nobody ever told you, neatly documented. You can't go wrong.

## I truly believe I can make you 1% more efficient

That doesn't sound like much, and honestly I think the number will be higher. But let's stick with 1%.

1% of an hour is 36 seconds. I'm confident that I can save you 36 seconds every time you go to save or retrieve a thing.

1% of a week is 24 minutes. So that's half an hour a week I'm giving you back. You should knock off early on Friday.

1% of a year is 2.4 days.<FootnoteRef number="6" ref="work-days" /> A nice long weekend.

But let's say that the system actually save you 2 minutes every hour. Everything multiplies by ~4. Now I'm saving you 10 days a year.

Enjoy your holiday.
