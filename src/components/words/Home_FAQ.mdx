# FAQ

## What do I get now?

We're still building the Small Business System, and expect to release something by the end of 2024.

It's taking a while -- 500 hours and counting. We want it to be right when we release it: updating a system that you've already implemented isn't ideal.

You will get preview access as soon as we have something ready.

If you sign up today you get:

- Our love. :-)
- Access to the private lounges.
  - There are two: Discourse (forum), and Discord (chat). Each has a members-only area.
  - Join both, or hang out in one or the other. Whatever you prefer.
- Access to all other Johnny.Decimal products.
  - The [workshop](https://jdcm.al/14.22/).
  - The [workbook](https://jdcm.al/14.21/).
  - The '[life admin](https://jdcm.al/14.11/)' pack.
- The _first 100_ members will receive an exclusive, limited-edition laptop sticker.

## What happens if my Gold membership expires?

You'll **never, ever** lose access to a Johnny.Decimal system that you're using.

For one, that's impossible. Your system is folders, files, and notes on _your_ computer. I couldn't take it away if I wanted to.

If your membership expires, you lose:

- Access to the private community.
- Any future updates to the system, including ops manuals.
- Any future releases, e.g. any system upgrades, app releases, etc.
  - (It's hard to know what this might be, as we haven't made them yet.)
