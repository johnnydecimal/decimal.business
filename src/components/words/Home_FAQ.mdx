# FAQ

## What do I get?

When released, the system will be:

- Two Johnny.Decimal areas, `10-19 Company administration` and `20-29 Product`, as a downloadable folder structure.
- Around 8 categories containing 150 specific IDs, hand-designed by me and Lucy.
  - Final numbers TBC: this is what we're currently doing.
- Index entries for each ID, explaining what it's for, examples, exceptions, pointers to related IDs, our design rationale, and any interesting links we found while doing the research.
- Detailed templates & patterns for each of your sub-folders.
- Dedicated channels on the forum & Discord.
- A couple of shared ops manuals to get us started.

I have plans to write an app to help you manage all of this, but that's a mid-2025 project.

## What's available now?

We're still building the Small Business System. We're working on it 6 days a week. It's taking a while--500 hours and counting. We want it to be right when we release it: updating the core of a system that you've already implemented isn't ideal.

If you sign up today you get:

- Our love. :-)
- Sneak-preview access to the system: we'll share what we can, as early as possible.
- Pre-launch pricing: prices increase when the system is released.
- Access to all other Johnny.Decimal products: the [workshop](https://jdcm.al/14.22/), [workbook](https://jdcm.al/14.21/), and '[life admin](https://jdcm.al/14.11/)' pack.
- The _first 100_ members will receive a limited-edition sticker.

As an added benefit, **Platinum** members receive free enrolment to [Learn with Lucy](https://learnwithlucy.rocks), our beginner-to-expert Excel course. Every small business owner needs to be proficient in Excel, and we honestly believe there's no better course out there.

## Is this a business expense that I can claim?

You'll need to confirm with your accountant, but you should be able to claim this as a business expense, yes. You'll receive a tax invoice. If you're in Australia, GST is included in the price.

## What happens if my Gold membership expires?

You'll **never, ever** lose access to a Johnny.Decimal system that you're using. For one, that's impossible. Your system is folders, files, and notes on _your_ computer. I couldn't take it away if I wanted to.

If your membership expires, you lose:

- Any future updates to the system, including ops manuals.
- Any future releases, e.g. any system upgrades, app releases, etc.
  - It's hard to know what this might be, as we haven't made them yet.

## I paid for the workshop, do I get a discount?

Yes, that's how we do things. There's an email in your inbox.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

There will be, but not until we launch. The monthly plan won't include access to the workshop, workbook, etc.

## When does my Gold membership renew?

One year after **the system release date**: not one year after your purchase. Annually thereafter as long as you remain a member.

Note that your initial purchase is not technically a subscription: it is a one-off. I haven't built the subscription service yet; when I do, I'll transition your membership.
