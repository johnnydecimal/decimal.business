# FAQ

## What do I get now?

We're still building the Small Business System, and expect the first release at the beginning of 2025. We're working on it 6 days a week.

It's taking a while--500 hours and counting. And Johnny's family is about to arrive from the UK for 3 weeks, so he'll be taking time off.

We want it to be right when we release it: updating the core of a system that you've already implemented isn't ideal.

If you sign up today you get:

- Our love. :-)
- Access to the private lounges.
  - There are two: Discourse (forum), and Discord (chat). Each has a members-only area.
  - Join both, or hang out in one or the other. Whatever you prefer.
- Sneak-preview access to the system: we'll share what we can, as early as possible.
- Pre-launch pricing: prices increase when the system is released.
- Access to all other Johnny.Decimal products.
  - The [workshop](https://jdcm.al/14.22/).
  - The [workbook](https://jdcm.al/14.21/).
  - The '[life admin](https://jdcm.al/14.11/)' pack.
- The _first 100_ members will receive a limited-edition sticker.

As an added benefit, you'll receive a 50% discount on [Learn with Lucy](https://jdcm.al/32.02/), our beginner-to-expert Excel course. Every small business owner needs to be proficient in Excel, and we honestly believe there's no better course out there.

## Is this a business expense that I can claim?

You'll need to confirm with your accountant, but you should be able to claim this as a business expense, yes.

You'll receive a tax invoice. If you're in Australia, GST is included in the price.

## What happens if my Gold membership expires?

You'll **never, ever** lose access to a Johnny.Decimal system that you're using.

For one, that's impossible. Your system is folders, files, and notes on _your_ computer. I couldn't take it away if I wanted to.

If your membership expires, you lose:

- Access to the private community.
- Any future updates to the system, including ops manuals.
- Any future releases, e.g. any system upgrades, app releases, etc.
  - It's hard to know what this might be, as we haven't made them yet.

## I paid <span style="font-variant-numeric: lining-nums;">$90</span> for the workshop, do I get a discount?

Of course. That's the Johnny.Decimal way.

There's an email in your inbox.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

There will be, but not until we launch. The monthly plan won't include access to the workshop, workbook, etc.

## When does my Gold membership renew?

One year after **the system release date**: not one year after your purchase. Annually thereafter as long as you remain a member.

Note that your initial purchase is not technically a subscription: it is a one-off. I haven't built the subscription service yet; when I do, I'll transition your membership.

## Is there a money-back guarantee?

Not on these pre-sale deals, no. Trust us: it's going to be amazing.
