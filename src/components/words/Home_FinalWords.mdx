# Final words

This has been a vision of mine for at least a decade: to create a framework for small business. To give you a sane place for all of the day-to-day stuff, allowing you to focus on your dream. To bring some much-needed efficiency to your world.

The first record I have is note `25.15 Business in a box`, dated 9th December 2014. That was so early that it scarcely even mentions the then-three-year-old idea of Johnny.Decimal.

Reviewing [that note](/25.15-business-in-a-box.txt), it's remarkable how much of the original vision remains.

And now I'm lucky enough to have Lucy to help me create it.

We are pouring our hearts in to this product. And we will continue to do so: we imagine that we will both spend most of the next few years working on this full-time.

**Being a member is like having us on your staff**. We will do everything in our power to make you successful.

Grab your [Platinum](#) or [Gold](#) membership now. And we'll see you in the lounge.
