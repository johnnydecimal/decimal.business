# A global standard for small business

Imagine a library without a catalogue. It's just a building full of books. Still nice, but not so useful. Now imagine if every library used a different catalogue.<FootnoteRef number="1" ref="dewey" /> You could still find a book, but there'd be no common language to guide you.

This is your business without a system like Johnny.Decimal. _This is most businesses on Earth_.

This is maddeningly inefficient. **We can do better**.

The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System is a global standard for organising small business administration. It is opinionated,<FootnoteRef number="2" ref="opinionated" /> and defines a place for everything that you might need to store.

This gives us a common language. Why might that be useful?

## We've made these decisions for you

Imagine having a well-defined place to store everything. So when you go to save or retrieve something, there's no decision to make. Just search [your index](https://jdcm.al/11.05/) for the appropriate ID: that's where it goes.

We do this using [the Johnny.Decimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com), a simple but powerful way of organising your stuff. It gives you a structure where nothing is more than a few clicks away, and one where most decisions are limited to, at most, 10 things. So it's much harder to get lost.

<Quote_Ellane />

Each type of thing in your business gets a unique ID which you can use to refer to it from anywhere. This applies to your files, notes, tasks, email, and physical items. They all share the same system.

At the heart is your index: a central record of everything in your business. You use this to tell yourself specifically where things are stored, and to clear up any ambiguity.

Simplify your life, eliminate clutter, and always know exactly where it all belongs. That's the power of Johnny.Decimal.
