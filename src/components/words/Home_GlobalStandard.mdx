# A global standard for small business

Imagine a library without a catalogue. Now you just have a building full of books. Still nice, but not so useful.

Now imagine if every library used a different catalogue.<FootnoteRef number="1" ref="opinionated" /> You could still find a book, but there'd be no common language to guide you.

This is your business without a system like Johnny.Decimal. _This is most businesses on Earth_.

This is maddeningly inefficient. **We can do better**.

The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System is a global standard for organising small business. It is opinionated,[^opinionated] and defines a place for everything that you might need to store.

[^opinionated]: In programming, 'opinionated' means that a language or tool enforces specific conventions and design patterns, guiding users towards a particular way of doing things. Opinionated tools make assumptions about how best to organise code or structure projects, often reducing flexibility but offering a streamlined experience that can simplify development and reduce decision fatigue.

This gives us a common language. Why might that be useful?

## We've made these decisions for you

Imagine having a well-defined place to store everything. So when you go to save or retrieve something, there's no decision to make: you just search your index for the appropriate ID, and that's where it goes.

We do this using [the Johnny.Decimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com), which is a simple but powerful way of organising your stuff. It gives you a structure where nothing is more than a few clicks away, and one where most decisions are limited to, at most, 10 things. So it's much harder to get lost.

Each item gets a unique ID which you can use to refer to it from anywhere.

This applies to your files, notes, tasks, email, and physical items. They all share the same system.

At the heart is your index: a central record of all of your stuff. You use this to tell yourself specifically where things are stored, and to clear up any ambiguity.

Simplify your life, eliminate clutter, and always know exactly where everything belongs. That's the power of Johnny.Decimal.
