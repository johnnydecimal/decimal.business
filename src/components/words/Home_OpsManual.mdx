# Your business operations manual

Love them or not, McDonald's is undeniably successful. Famously, they're all the same, no matter where in the world you are.

How? **Operations manuals**.

Imagine if it was up to each store to calculate the oil temperature and cooking time for the fries. That would be horribly inefficient, and the fries would always be different. Instead, McDonald's has documented the process in an operations (ops) manual that's shared across the world.

But this is what we're all doing for, say, our quarterly tax filings. Each one of us has to invent our own process.

So we'll document this for you, in a standard set of ops manuals.<FootnoteRef number="3" ref="ops-manuals" /> For example, where to save those receipts so you can file your returns efficiently. And you'll create and share your own: how to turn off the salon's alarm system; how to set up your market stall.

You might worry that I'm trying to homogenise small business: to take away what makes you unique. Quite the opposite: I'm trying to _standardise_ the boring stuff that we all have to do.

Because when you don't have to think about your backups, you have _more_ time to think about your product and your customers. And so the system will define this process for you. That's what your ops manuals are. Just follow them, and get on with something more interesting.
