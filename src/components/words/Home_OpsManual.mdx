# Your business operations manual

Love them or not,[^maccas] McDonald's is undeniably successful. Famously, they're all the same, no matter where in the world you are.

How? **Operations manuals**.

[^maccas]: We do (love them).

Imagine if every cook at McDonald's had to calculate the oil temperature and cooking time for the fries. That would be horribly inefficient, and the fries would be different at every store. Instead, McDonald's has documented the process in an operations (ops) manual that's shared across the world.

But this is what we're all doing for, say, our IT system backups. Each one of us is working out how to do it, which service to use, and how to check that they're working.

So we'll document this for you, in a standard set of ops manuals.[^ops-manuals] And you'll create and share your own: how to turn off the salon's alarm system; how (and how often) to clean the coffee machine.

[^ops-manuals]: These will be developed over time, in a democratic process: we'll ask the community what you need next, and prioritise accordingly.

You might worry that I'm trying to homogenise small business: to take away what makes you unique. Quite the opposite: I'm trying to _standardise_ the boring stuff that we all have to do.

Because when you don't have to think about your backups, you have _more_ time to think about your product and your customers. And so the system will define this process for you. That's what your ops manuals are. Just follow them, and get on with something more interesting.
