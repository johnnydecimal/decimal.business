        <h2>A global standard</h2>
        <p>
          The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System provides a structured,
          opinionated method to organize everything in a business, creating a
          universal 'catalogue' for all files, tasks, and items.
        </p>
        <p>
          By assigning each item a unique ID, it simplifies storage, retrieval,
          and communication, eliminating inefficiency and decision fatigue.

        <h2>People getting stuff done</h2>
        <p>
          There are places online where people gather to discuss get-rich-quick
          schemes.
        </p>
        <p>This is not one of them.</p>
        <p>
          This is a place to get <strong>real work done</strong>. This is a
          place for people who are <strong>executing their idea</strong>, not
          for those who are still dreaming.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Be organised</h2>
        <p>Business is hard.</p>
        <p>Filing things is harder!</p>
        <p>
          The Johnny.Decimal System tackles the chaos of business by bringing
          order to everythingâ€”files, emails, tasks, notesâ€”so you always know
          where things belong and can stay focused on what matters.

        <h2>Your operations manual</h2>
        <p>
          McDonald's success comes from standardized operations manuals that
          ensure consistency worldwide.
        </p><p>
          The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System applies this concept to
          everyday business tasks, providing clear, shared documentation to
          streamline routine processes like IT backups, so you can focus on what
          makes your business unique.

    <h1>A global standard for small business</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine a library without a catalogue. Now you just have a building full
      of books. Still nice, but not so useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now imagine if every library used a different catalogue.<sup
        id="fnref:dewey"><a href="#fn:dewey">dewey</a></sup
      > You could still find a book, but there'd be no common language to guide you.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is your business without a system like Johnny.Decimal. This is <i
        >most businesses on Earth</i
      >.
    </p>
    <p>This is maddeningly inefficient. <strong>We can do better</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System is a global standard for
      organising small business. It is opinionated,<sup id="fnref:opinionated"
        ><a href="#fn:opinionated">opinionated</a></sup
      > and defines a place for everything that you might need to store.
    </p>

    <p>This gives us a common language. Why might that be useful?</p>

    <h2>We've made these decisions for you</h2><p>
      Imagine having a well-defined place to store everything. So when you go to
      save or retrieve something, there's no decision to make: you just search
      your index for the appropriate ID, and that's where it goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do this using the Johnny.Decimal system, which is a simple but powerful
      way of organising your stuff. It gives you a structure where nothing is
      more than a few clicks away, and one where most decisions are limited to,
      at most, 10 things. So it's much harder to get lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each item gets a unique ID which you can use to refer to it from anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This applies to your files, notes, tasks, email, and physical items. They
      all share the same system.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the heart is your index: a central record of all of your stuff. You use
      this to tell yourself specifically where things are stored, and to clear
      up any ambiguity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simplify your life, eliminate clutter, and always know exactly where
      everything belongs. That's the power of Johnny.Decimal.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">â‰¡</p>

    <h1>Your business operations manual</h1>
    <p>
      Love them or not,<sup id="fnref:maccas"
        ><a href="#fn:maccas">maccas</a></sup
      > McDonald's is undeniably successful. Famously, they're all the same, no matter
      where in the world you are. How? <b>Operations manuals.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine if every cook at McDonald's had to calculate the oil temperature
      and cooking time for the fries. That would be horribly inefficient, and
      the fries would be different at every store. Instead, McDonald's has
      documented the process in an operations (ops) manual that's shared across
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is what we're all doing for, say, our IT system backups. Each one
      of us is working out how to do it, which service to use, and how to check
      that they're working.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we'll document this for you, in a standard set of ops manuals.<sup
        id="fnref:ops-manuals"><a href="#fn:ops-manuals">ops-manuals</a></sup
      > And you'll create and share your own: how to turn off the salon's alarm system;
      how (and how often) to clean the coffee machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might worry that I'm trying to homogenise small business: to take away
      what makes you unique. Quite the opposite: I'm trying to <i>standardise</i
      > the boring stuff that we all have to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because when you don't have to think about your backups, you have <i
        >more</i
      > time to think about your product and your customers. And so the system will
      define this process for you. That's what your ops manuals are. Just follow
      them, and get on with something more interesting.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">â‰¡</p>

    <h1>A community of your peers</h1>

    <p>
      With this shared language, we can all help each other much more
      effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm in 'small business' forums. They have channels with broad names like
      'finance' or 'technology'. And so the conversations in them are broad, and
      not particularly helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the community mirrors the structure of the system, we can start to
      talk specifics. Need help with your backups? Jump in to <code
        >14.14 Backups</code
      > and hopefully there's a helpful nerd on hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      And you can repay the favour. Your speciality might be <code
        >11.22 Business insurance</code
      >, which us nerds typically know little about. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that we're going to keep our channels focused. We'll be
      moderating: if you stray off topic, we'll nudge you back.
    </p>
    <h2>The system learns</h2><p>
      The problem with forums and chat channels is that knowledge typically gets
      lost over time. We all know how painful it is trying to search a chat
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we'll be actively looking for knowledge that should be persistent, and
      feeding it back in to the system. That might be improving the descriptions
      in your index so that you can find things more easily; clarifying
      ambiguity; or creating and improving your ops manuals.
    </p>
    <p>Either way, that's our job. Not yours.</p>

    <h2>We do this together</h2><p>
      There's a reason many of us don't have good backups, or that we haven't
      confirmed that they actually work. It's because it's really boring! Let's
      not pretend that it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we can help each other by doing it together. We'll coordinate the
      community to keep you on track. There's already a <a
        href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en">World Backup Day</a
      >, on 31st March. So let's use that and spend an hour or so making sure
      that everything's working. Now one of you just needs to come up with a
      backup playlist...
    </p>

    <h2>This isn't for your get-rich-quick idea</h2><p>
      There are forums on the internet full of 'tech bros' looking for their
      next get-rich-quick idea.
    </p>
    <p>This isn't one of them.</p>
    <p>
      If you don't already have a business idea, this is not the place to find
      one. This is a place for people who are executing, or for those who have
      an idea and are just starting.
    </p>
    <p>It's a place for the doers, not the dreamers.</p>
    <p>
      Of course, there's always a place for idle chitchat. So there's a channel, <code
        >#water-coolerðŸš°</code
      >, for those of you that want to catch up on weekend plans, favourite
      shows, or the latest sports news.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">â‰¡</p>

    <h1>None of us got any training</h1>

    <p>
      I remember the workplace of 2000. We had computers, sure. But they did far
      less. They were much slower. And we didn't all carry one round in our
      pocket.<sup id="fnref:palm"><a href="#fn:palm">palm</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      25 short years later and computers are <i>everything</i>. Everything you
      do depends on a computer. You might have the most analogue business in the
      worldâ€”maybe you make furniture by handâ€”but still, your entire business is
      on the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we all got that three-month training course to bring us up to
      speeâ€“ oh, wait... that's right. None of us got any training!
    </p>
    <p>
      The result? Inefficiency. My least favourite thing rears its ugly head
      again. So you can think of this system as the IT training you never got.
      We'll show you how to do it right: how to save things, how to name things,
      what's safe to duplicate, what isn't. All the basic stuff that nobody ever
      told you.
    </p>

    <h2>I truly believe I can make you 1% more efficient</h2>
    <p>
      That doesn't sound like much, and honestly I think the number will be
      higher. But let's stick with 1%.
    </p>
    <p>
      1% of an hour is 36 seconds. I'm confident that I can save you 36 seconds
      every time you go to save or retrieve a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      1% of a week is 24 minutes. So that's half an hour a week I'm giving you
      back. You should knock off early on Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      1% of a year<sup id="fnref:work-days"
        ><a href="#fn:work-days">work-days</a></sup
      > is 2.4 days. A nice long weekend.
    </p>

    <p>
      But let's say that the system actually save you 2 minutes every hour.
      Everything multiplies by ~4. Now I'm saving you 10 days a year.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy your holiday.</p>
