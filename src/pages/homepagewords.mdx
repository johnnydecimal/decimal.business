# A global standard for small business

Imagine a library without a catalogue. Now you just have a building full of books. Still nice, but not so useful.

Now imagine if every library used a different catalogue.[^dewey] You could still find a book, but there'd be no common language to guide you.

[^dewey]: Vs. the standard, which is the (imperfect, but nevertheless standard) Dewey Decimal Classification.

This is your business without a system like Johnny.Decimal. _This is most businesses on Earth_.

This is maddeningly inefficient. **We can do better**.

The Johnny.Decimal Small Business System is a global standard for organising small business. It is opinionated,[^opinionated] and defines a place for everything that you might need to store.

[^opinionated]: In programming, 'opinionated' means that a language or tool enforces specific conventions and design patterns, guiding users towards a particular way of doing things. Opinionated tools make assumptions about how best to organise code or structure projects, often reducing flexibility but offering a streamlined experience that can simplify development and reduce decision fatigue.

This gives us a common language. Why might that be useful?

## We've made these decisions for you

Imagine having a well-defined place to store everything. So when you go to save or retrieve something, there's no decision to make: you just search your index for the appropriate ID, and that's where it goes.

We do this using the Johnny.Decimal system, which is a simple but powerful way of organising your stuff. It gives you a structure where nothing is more than a few clicks away, and one where most decisions are limited to, at most, 10 things. So it's much harder to get lost.

Each item gets a unique ID which you can use to refer to it from anywhere.

This applies to your files, notes, tasks, email, and physical items. They all share the same system.

At the heart is your index: a central record of all of your stuff. You use this to tell yourself specifically where things are stored, and to clear up any ambiguity.

Simplify your life, eliminate clutter, and always know exactly where everything belongs. That's the power of Johnny.Decimal.

# Your business operations manual

Love them or not,[^maccas] McDonald's is undeniably successful. Famously, they're all the same, no matter where in the world you are. How? **Operations manuals**.

[^maccas]: We do (love them).

Imagine if every cook at McDonald's had to calculate the oil temperature and cooking time for the fries. That would be horribly inefficient, and the fries would be different at every store. Instead, McDonald's has documented the process in an operations (ops) manual that's shared across the world.

But this is what we're all doing for, say, our IT system backups. Each one of us is working out how to do it, which service to use, and how to check that they're working.

So we'll document this for you, in a standard set of ops manuals.[^ops-manuals] And you'll create and share your own: how to turn off the salon's alarm system; how (and how often) to clean the coffee machine.

[^ops-manuals]: These will be developed over time, in a democratic process: we'll ask the community what you need next, and prioritise accordingly.

You might worry that I'm trying to homogenise small business: to take away what makes you unique. Quite the opposite: I'm trying to _standardise_ the boring stuff that we all have to do.

Because when you don't have to think about your backups, you have _more_ time to think about your product and your customers. And so the system will define this process for you. That's what your ops manuals are. Just follow them, and get on with something more interesting.

<HR />

# A community of your peers

With this shared language, we can all help each other much more effectively.

I'm in 'small business' forums. They have channels with broad names like 'finance' or 'technology'. And so the conversations in them are broad, and not particularly helpful.

When the community mirrors the structure of the system, we can start to talk specifics. Need help with your backups? Jump in to `14.14 Data storage & backups` and hopefully there's a helpful nerd on hand!

And you can repay the favour. Your speciality might be 11.22 Business insurance, which us nerds typically know little about.

This means that we're going to keep our channels focused. We'll be moderating: if you stray off topic, we'll nudge you back.

## The system learns

The problem with forums and chat channels is that knowledge typically gets lost over time. We all know how painful it is trying to search a chat channel.

So we'll be actively looking for knowledge that should be persistent, and feeding it back in to the system. That might be improving the descriptions in your index so that you can find things more easily; clarifying ambiguity; or creating and improving your ops manuals.

Either way, that's our job. Not yours.

## We do this together

There's a reason many of us don't have good backups, or that we haven't confirmed that they actually work. It's because it's really boring! Let's not pretend that it isn't.

But we can help each other by doing it together. We'll coordinate the community to keep you on track. There's already a [World Backup Day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/), 31st March. So let's use that and spend an hour or so making sure that everything's working. Now one of you just needs to come up with a backup playlist...

### This isn't for your get-rich-quick idea

There are forums on the internet full of 'tech bros' looking for their next get-rich-quick idea.

This isn't one of them.

If you don't already have a business idea, this is not the place to find one. This is a place for people who are executing, or for those who have an idea and are just starting.

It's a place for the doers, not the dreamers.

Of course, there's always a place for idle chitchat. So there's a channel, `#water-coolerðŸš°`, for those of you that want to catch up on weekend plans, favourite shows, or the latest sports news.

# None of us got any training

I remember the workplace of 2000. We had computers, sure. But they did far less. They were much slower. And we didn't all carry one round in our pocket.[^palm]

[^palm]: I did, because I was a nerd. I had the first [PalmPilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot). It didn't do much.

25 short years later and computers are _everything_. Everything you do depends on a computer. You might have the most analogue business in the worldâ€”maybe you make furniture by handâ€”but still, your entire business is on the computer.

Fortunately, we all got that three-month training course to bring us up to speeâ€“ oh, wait... that's right. None of us got any training!

The result? Inefficiency. My least favourite thing rears its ugly head again. So you can think of this system as the IT training you never got. We'll show you how to do it right: how to save things, how to name things, what's safe to duplicate, what isn't. All the basic stuff that nobody ever told you.

## I truly believe I can make you 1% more efficient

That doesn't sound like much, and honestly I think the number will be higher. But let's stick with 1%.

1% of an hour is 36 seconds. I'm confident that I can save you 36 seconds every time you go to save or retrieve a thing.

1% of a week is 24 minutes. So that's half an hour a week I'm giving you back. You should knock off early on Friday.

1% of a year is 2.4 days.[^work-days] A nice long weekend.

[^work-days]: Assuming a humane 240 working days: 48 weeks at 5 days/week.

But let's say that the system actually save you 2 minutes every hour. Everything multiplies by ~4. Now I'm saving you 10 days a year.

Enjoy your holiday.
